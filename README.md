# TIC-TAC-TOE
TIC, TAC, TOE Game with a GUI. Group members: Tommy Gray and Brandon Fernandez

Tic Tac Toe game that functions within a graphical user interface. Designing a Tic Tac Toe game that everyone can play and enjoy with unique features such as KSU color theme background, stop watch timer that gives each user approximately 3-5 seconds to give their input, and have music playing in the background to give users a more enjoyable experience. Instead of the usually 3 row and 3 columns, we want to add more row and columns to make the game longer and more challenging. Group members: Tommy Gray and Brandon Fernandez
